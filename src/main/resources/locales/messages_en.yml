# All messages can be colored, use color codes as '&' symbol and color index after it.
# Some messages has placeholders; it is words which allocated with '%' symbols: '%player%', '%currency%' and other.
# Please, don't edit this placeholders because they will be replaced to real data and you can miss it.
# Also don't edit messages sections structure, it's very important for internal code of plugin.
#
# If you see notification in game chat about an undiscovered message, this messages file is outdated and you must regenerate it;
