# PEconomy
Minecraft economy plugin with dollar and euro wallets.

May work on MC version 1.12.X - 1.17.X (Paper or Spigot).<br>
You can operate with two currencies by default: dollar and euro (second wallet may be donation for example).<br>
Sure, you can add own currencies or remove defaults, easy :)<br>
This plugin hooks into Vault as economy provider and uses [SKLibrary](https://github.com/SoKnight/SKLibrary) as dependency.
